# REGEX-TUTORIAL

Last month I took interest in learning Regex, so I started watching the tutorials from user @corey_schafer on youtube and practice with some exercises from the website "www.hackerrank.com". Whatching videos and doing coding challanges was cool and all, but then I was introduced to the Feynman techique. In a nutshell, it states that: " The best way to learn something is to try to teach it". So, here I am, trying to teach what I understood so far in this repository with my own words

## But what is regex?

You may wonder, if you stumbled in this repo by accident. Well, regex stands for "Regular Expressions", A system for describing text patterns like "four digits in a row" or "telephone numbers beggining with '+5521'" in a way that is easily processable by computers. It is used in a vast array of applications, like getting the input of GNU/LINUX CLI programs; pre processing for natural language processing IAs and searching for terms in Large Databseses.

The purpose of this tutorial is not to teach how software, under the hood, uses regexes to match strings with given patters. But how to read and write expressions for your program using your favorite programming language.

Thats why this repo is divided in two folders: The first one, lessons, teaches how to buildthe expressions for your desired patterns. The other one, codes, have small scripts written in python, haskell and javascript to examplify the uses of regex in practice.

## I would like to thank:
